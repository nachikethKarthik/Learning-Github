# Welcome to the learning github repository !
If you are an absolute newbie to git and github this is the  place for you.
Here i have documented the learnings and steps i took to learn all about this version control system.
Feel free to diverge from my path wherever necessary it matches your use needs.

## What exactly is Git
- Git is a free and open source version control system.
## What is version control
- In simple words version control is a way for programmers to track code changes.
- You start by saving an initial version of your code into git , as you continue to change your code you keep saving over the initial version and creating newer versions.
- This helps us keep track of the changes we make,find bugs and go back to previous versions of code if required.
