# Welcome to the learning github repository !
- If you are an absolute newbie to git and github this is the  place for you.
- Here i have documented the learnings and steps i took to learn all about this version control system.
- Feel free to diverge from my path wherever necessary if it doesnt match your use needs.
## What exactly is Git
- Git is a free and open source version control system.
- It is a tool used to track changes made in your code.
## What is version control
- In simple words version control is a way for programmers to track code changes.
- You start by saving an initial version of your code into git , as you continue to change your code you keep saving over the initial version and creating newer versions.
- This helps us keep track of the changes we make,find bugs and go back to previous versions of code if required.
## What is Github
- Github is an online platform(Website) which shows all the code and changes to code which you saved on git .
- Being an online forum it also enables you to work with others and access their code.It also allows others to acces and change your code.
- It allows you to put all of the code for your project into a single folder(also called REPOSITORY) and make it available for potential employers.
## Still unclear about the difference between git and github ? 
- Here is a link which helped me out : https://blog.devmountain.com/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/
## Step1 : Download Visual Studio Code
- Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ .
- Go to https://www.youtube.com/ and search "How to download VS code".
- Follow along with any one video and download VS code.
### What is Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio Code or VS Code for short is a code editor.
### What is a code editor ?
- Code can be typed out anywhere.Be it in a notepad file or in a word document.But both Notepad and Microsoft Word are unable to understand that what is being typed is code so the process becomes tedious.This is where code editors come in.
- There are certain apps which work just like notepad but are able to detect the code you type and format it into a neat and readable form.They also have additional features like autocomplete,auto format,user snippets and many others.
- VS Code is one such application.
